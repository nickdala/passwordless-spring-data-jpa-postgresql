# passwordless-spring-data-jpa-postgresql

Sample project for Spring Data JPA with passwordless connection to Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server via Service Connector

## Deploy

1. Log in to Azure
Before deploying, you must be authenticated to Azure and have the appropriate subscription selected. Run the following command to authenticate:

```
az login
```

Set the subscription to the one you want to use (you can use az account list to list available subscriptions):

```
export AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="<your-subscription-id>"
```

```
az account set --subscription $AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
```

Use the next command to login with the Azure Dev CLI (AZD) tool:

```
azd auth login
```

2. Create a new environment

Next we provide the AZD tool with variables that it uses to create the deployment. The first thing we initialize is the AZD environment with a name.

```
azd env new <pick_a_name>
```

Select the subscription that will be used for the deployment:

```
azd env set AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID $AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
```

Set the Azure region to be used:

```
azd env set AZURE_LOCATION <pick_a_region>
```

3. Create the Azure resources and deploy the code

Run the following command to create the Azure resources and deploy the code (about 15-minutes to complete):

```
azd up
```

The deployment process will output the URL of the deployed application.

```

## Bug

The application will fail with the following error:

```
[org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/sql/init/DataSourceInitializationConfiguration.class]: Failed to execute SQL script statement #1 of URL [jar:nested:/home/site/wwwroot/app.jar/!BOOT-INF/classes/!/schema.sql]: create table if not exists todos ( todo_id bigint not null, title varchar(255), is_completed boolean, primary key (todo_id) )at org.springframework.beans.factory.support.AbstractAutowireCapableBeanFactory.initializeBean(AbstractAutowireCapableBeanFactory.java:1786) ~[spring-beans-6.1.6.jar!/:6.1.6]at 
```

## Test the application

The previous command will output the URL of the deployed application. You can use this URL to test the application.

### Create a new Todo item

```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title":"Buy milk"}' <URL>/todos
```
